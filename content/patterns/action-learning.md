prisma designs and facilitates multi-stakeholder [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md), grounded in partner [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hub/hubs.md) in different [bioregions](/glossary/bioregion). Through our [index](processes/enrolment/index.md) process, we onboard the following stakeholders into an alignment process lasting multiple weeks, culminating in an intensive:

1. [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hub/hubs.md)
2. [practice networks](/collaborators/communities%20of%20practice/practice%20networks.md)
3. participants
4. partners

the core purpose of organising all these capacity-generating roles around an intensive is to create the conditions for a systemic intervention in which *[practice](/glossary/Practice.md)* is *applied* on-the-ground. applying practice means embodying the principles by which the practice comes to life, generating experiential learning value. 

The product of each action-learning journey is a [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md). These case-studies are a multi-media, multi-perspective account of the experience, that serve the purpose of offering the learnings to a broader audience: action-learning, action-learning. The content of these case-studies is produced throughout the process through a kind of *participation-as-content-creation* practice:

1. meeting recordings
2. audio recordings
3. videos
4. learning exercises
5. documentation
6. various participation signals (more to come)

Whereas a case-study focusses on a single action-learning journey, this page speaks to action-learning as an underlying pattern repeating throughout all that we're working on. Prisma as a distributed participation platform requires the capability to organise action-learning intensives and communicate this from many perspectives.

In addition to generating the above learning material, which is occurring at the participation level, there is a second order of production aims, client-facing, which exists at three levels:

1. Features/ feature sets (e.g. apps, [practice currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies))
2. Organisations/ organisational forms that support the ongoing development and application of practice (e.g. practice-DAOs)
3. Ecosystem shifts and pathways (e.g. an integrative co-design roadmap with multiple stakeholders and aligned partners at the landscape/ ecosystem level)

The core processes being worked on so far are:

1. [index](processes/enrolment/index.md)
2. [ground-potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising.md)
3. [enacting](/processes/enactment)
4. [evaluating](/processes/evaluation)
5. [process-infrastructuring](/processes/process-infrastructuring)
