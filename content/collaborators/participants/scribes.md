# Scribes

Scribes are agents of articulation, transforming lived experiences into documented knowledge.

Scribes are stewards, their attentiveness and ability to capture essence being absolutely essential for the [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) to be meaningfully expressed through documentation.

Scribes are responsible for ensuring the docs are representative of the work happening on the ground, stewarding the expression of the essence of place, and creating a sense of wholeness in the documentation.

This attentiveness to essence is the prerequisite for effective capturing of the various different capacities present in a cohort - artists, engineers, community leaders, farmers, cooks, and guests, to name just a few. Each voice has an essential perspective to contribute in making visible the ways in which a system is trying to evolve, and scribes ensure these voices are documented with clarity and intention.

It is crucial that scribes appreciate their relationship with the character and potential of the context in which the ALJ is being hosted. The [hubs](collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hub/hubs.md) play an important role in helping develop those relationships, creating spaces in which local stakeholders can illuminate the locality's systems and particularities.

Front-end skills are a nice-to-have and can make the role really enjoyable as it's a hybrid between technical documentation and direct engagement with the work, communities and places. It's a very active role, and those who scribe will learn a great deal through the process.
