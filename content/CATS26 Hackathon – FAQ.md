# **CATS26 Hackathon – Frequently Asked Questions**

### **1\. Can hub leads also join the hackathon as participants?**

Yes and no. Hub leads can form teams and support work on hackathon projects. They are encouraged to take part alongside their community members. Note: Hub leads will have a different and distinct role compared to participants. Hub leads will serve as advisors and organizers. 

### **2\. What are the prizes and how many winners will be selected?**

There are 3 phases of prizes.

1. November: Hubs selected to host in-person hackathons in November \- December. Budget will be awarded for these hackathons exact amount TBD.  
2. December: There is a total of 10 000 ADA in prizes that will be awarded in December for top teams from each location. *Top 3 teams will be offered tiered prizes for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.*  
3. February: In addition to ADA prizes, the **top 5 teams across Africa will have an additional prize**. Representatives from the top teams will be supported to travel to Nairobi for in-person intensive incubator support. Hub leads will accompany the winning teams. 

### **3\. Can more than one project from the same country or hub win?**

Yes. Winners are selected based on project quality but not location. If two or more strong projects come from one country or hub, they can all qualify.

### **4\. Where can I find more information about the hackathon?**

Right now, the **landing page and Luma registration links** are the main sources. More detailed materials including slides and criteria will be shared during the onboarding calls. A **Telegram group** will also be created to help share updates quickly.

### **5\. What are the project categories?**

We are not fixing categories in advance. Instead, teams will define **local problem statements** from their own communities. Categories such as smart contracts, NFTs, scaling, etc., will emerge from the problems participants bring.

### **6\. How will judging be done?**

External judges will be brought in to evaluate projects. A **scoring criteria and judging process** will be clarified before the actual hackathons begin. The aim is to make judging fair and holistic.

### **7\. Will there be support for teams who spend resources but don’t win?**

We will try to make the prizes fair so that as many participants can be awarded either through (a) hosting a local hackathon, or (b) in the December prize batch. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee any winners or offer any reimbursement of costs spent in participating in this hackathon if the above are not met.

**8\. How will participant registration be linked with specific hubs?**

The first step is a general sign-up form. Later, during the **enrollment phase**, participants will be linked to specific hubs and teams. At that stage, more details will be collected.

### **9\. Can participants be filtered early to avoid wasting time?**

One option is to require teams to submit their **problem statement and proposed solution early**, before full hackathon work begins. This can help ensure only serious teams continue. However it is under consideration and more details will be communicated soon. 

### **10\. Will there be clear communication materials?**

Yes. In addition to the website, a **short explainer video** will be produced and shared on social media. This will help people understand the hackathon process easily even if they don’t read the website.

### **11\. What happens next?**

* Onboarding calls will share more details and slides.  
* Criteria and prize structures will be finalized soon.
