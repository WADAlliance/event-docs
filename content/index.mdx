This isn't just a hackathon. It's a gateway into the MeTTa Cycle, a developer-focused, AGI-aligned training and development pipeline being built by Dr. Ben Goertzel and the core SingularityNET team.

Join SingularityNET, BeyondTheCode.ai and Wada for a one-of-a-kind experience that blends technical training, real-world problem solving, and decentralized innovation.
